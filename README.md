# I-Care by RandomAIz (Team 77) - MLDA-Hackathon-2021
I-Care is an integrated self-care journaling mobile application that seeks to promote mental health well-being. It provides users with a safe space to express their emotions, whether it is through journaling or conversing with Charis, our conversational chatbot, allowing users  to track their emotions and mental health progress over time. With integrated features such as an emotional tracker powered by Natural Language Processing, I-Care is able to identify potential depression and suicidal tendencies and directs users to seek the appropriate mental health assistance, whether it is connecting them with a mental health hotline or recommending them to a therapist.
